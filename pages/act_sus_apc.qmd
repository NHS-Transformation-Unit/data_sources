# Data Source Description
The Admitted Patient Care (APC) dataset is part of the **Secondary Users Services (SUS)** repository and contains information about each admission to a healthcare provider for NHS patients. The dataset contains information about admissions covering topics such as:

* The admission method, i.e. was the patient admitted electively for a planned or booked procedure.
* Demographics of the patient such as age, gender and ethnicity.
* Diagnoses recorded alongside the admission both for a primary diagnosis and any secondary conditions.
* When the patient was admitted and discharged to derive the length of stay of the admission.

More details about the fields collected within the APC dataset can be found within the [NHS Data Dictionary](https://www.datadictionary.nhs.uk/data_sets/cds_v6-2/cds_v6-2_type_130_-_admitted_patient_care_-_finished_general_episode_cds.html) or [SUS SEM Extract Specification](https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/assets/website-assets/services/sus/sus-guidance/sem_extract_specification-v-1.3.xlsx).


## Spells and Episodes

* __A Hospital Provider Spell__ is the total continuous stay of a PATIENT using a Hospital Bed on premises controlled by a Health Care Provider during which medical care is the responsibility of one or more CONSULTANTS, or the PATIENT is receiving care under one or more Nursing Episodes or Midwife Episodes in a WARD. [NHS Data Dictionary](https://www.datadictionary.nhs.uk/nhs_business_definitions/hospital_provider_spell.html)
* __A Consultant Episode__ (Hospital Provider) is the time a PATIENT spends in the continuous care of one CONSULTANT using Hospital Site or Care Home bed(s) of one Health Care Provider or, in the case of shared care, in the care of two or more CONSULTANTS. [NHS Data Dictionary](https://www.datadictionary.nhs.uk/nhs_business_definitions/consultant_episode__hospital_provider_.html)

Therefore, a *spell* covers the period of care between the patient being admitted and discharged and consists of one or more *episodes* depending on the care they receive during that *spell*. The figure below shows three example hospital spells:

In the first example a patient has been admitted on 12/11/2023 until they are discharged on 17/11/2023. During the admission they are under the care of a single consultant within General Surgery. Therefore, the entire spell was constructed from a single episode. Each episode of care will also have a diagnoses codes recorded against them. The primary diagnosis code in this case was **K740** - Hepatic Fibrosis.

In the second example, the patient was admitted on 12/11/2023 initially under the care of a consultant in General Surgery. They were diagnosed with unspecified liver disease (K769). The next day the patient was transferred to a consultant in Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Surgery. There diagnosis was updated to **K740** - Hepatic Fibrosis and they remained under the care of this consultant until their discharge on 16/11/2023.

In the final example, the patient is transferred a day after admission to Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Surgery. Here they are diagnosed with Hepatic Fibrosis. Subsequently, they have a third episode of care under a Respiratory consultant where they are primarily treated for influenza.

## Publisher
NHS Digital (now part of NHS England) receives the APCS submissions from providers delivering inpatient care to NHS patients. The raw data used for analysis is not publicly available, however, NHS Digital publishes some analyses of APC. Their [Hospital Admitted Patient Care Activity, 2023-24](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/hospital-admitted-patient-care-activity/2023-24) provides an overview of activity reported in APC.

## Accessing the Data
APC data is stored and accessible within several repositories across the NHS for use by approved analysts. One of the analysts will be available to discuss any potential analysis.

## Frequency of Publishing
Some of the data tables contain flows of daily APC updates, typically 48-72 hours in arrears. However, these are subject to change so there are still also monthly APC submission data tables. These will typically be the most appropriate source of data for our projects.

# Using the Data
The data can be used to answer and support questions such as:

* How many elective daycase admissions have there been in the last twelve months across England where the patient underwent a gastroscopy.
* How has the length of stay profile changed for emergency admissions for patients with a dementia diagnosis across an ICB in the last five years?
* What proportion of patients admitted with a cardiovascular condition also have a secondary diabetes diagnosis?
* How do admission rates for alcohol related admissions vary by deprivation decile?
