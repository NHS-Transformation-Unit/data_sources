The purpose of the website is to provide you with an overview of available data, where to find it and how it can be used.\n\n\nHow can it be used?\nThis website will be continually developed to add new data sources that are useful to be aware of for our projects. Use the navigation bar on the left hand side of the page to select a data source domain. The individual pages will provide information on:\n\nThe background to the data source. How is it curated? Who publishes it? How often?\nWhere the data can be accessed including links for publicly available datasets.\nThe types of questions that the data can help to answer and any limitations on its use.\n\n\n\nAre we missing a data source?\nIf you think that there is a useful source of data that we are missing then please let us know so that we can add this. You can either:\n\nSpeak to one of the analysts and we can chat about what to include.\nIf you are feeling brave, create yourself a GitHub account and add an issue to the repository."

Topics of interest include:\n\nUnderstanding the performance of A&E departments in achieving the four-hour standard. Monitoring and tracking performance against this standard over time.\nExploring elective waiting times and understanding how the backlog of elective care has changed since the pandemic.\n\nThis section provides information and links to operational and performance datasets that may be of use."
