The purpose of the website is to provide you with an overview of available data, where to find it and how it can be used.\n\n\nHow can it be used?\nThis website will be continually developed to add new data sources that are useful to be aware of for our projects. Use the navigation bar on the left hand side of the page to select a data source domain. The individual pages will provide information on:\n\nThe background to the data source. How is it curated? Who publishes it? How often?\nWhere the data can be accessed including links for publicly available datasets.\nThe types of questions that the data can help to answer and any limitations on its use.\n\n\n\nAre we missing a data source?\nIf you think that there is a useful source of data that we are missing then please let us know so that we can add this. You can either:\n\nSpeak to one of the analysts and we can chat about what to include.\nIf you are feeling brave, create yourself a GitHub account and add an issue to the repository."

Routinely collected activity datasets enable detailed analysis and modelling on topics such as:\n\nWho is attending Emergency Departments and Urgent Care Centres? What conditions are they presenting with and how have these presentations changed over time?\nWho is admitted to a hospital bed? What proportion of this activity is non-elective? What conditions are people admitted with and what treatment do they receive whilst an inpatient?\nHow many patients are being seen in outpatient clinics? What treatment are these patients receiving as part of the consultation? How many don’t attend and what happens to them after the appointment?\nHow many patients are referred to Mental Health services? Which teams are these patients referred to and are they seen within an outpatient or inpatient setting?"

NHS Data Dictionary\nA Consultant Episode (Hospital Provider) is the time a PATIENT spends in the continuous care of one CONSULTANT using Hospital Site or Care Home bed(s) of one Health Care Provider or, in the case of shared care, in the care of two or more CONSULTANTS. NHS Data Dictionary\n\nTherefore, a spell covers the period of care between the patient being admitted and discharged and consists of one or more episodes depending on the care they receive during that spell. The figure below shows three example hospital spells:\n\n \nIn the first example a patient has been admitted on 12/11/2023 until they are discharged on 17/11/2023. During the admission they are under the care of a single consultant within General Surgery. Therefore, the entire spell was constructed from a single episode. Each episode of care will also have a diagnoses codes recorded against them. The primary diagnosis code in this case was K740 - Hepatic Fibrosis.\nIn the second example, the patient was admitted on 12/11/2023 initially under the care of a consultant in General Surgery. They were diagnosed with unspecified liver disease (K769). The next day the patient was transferred to a consultant in Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Surgery. There diagnosis was updated to K740 - Hepatic Fibrosis and they remained under the care of this consultant until their discharge on 16/11/2023.\nIn the final example, the patient is transferred a day after admission to Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Surgery. Here they are diagnosed with Hepatic Fibrosis. Subsequently, they have a third episode of care under a Respiratory consultant where they are primarily treated for influenza."
